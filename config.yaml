      I am a software developer who thrives on crafting engaging web experiences. On my own time I enjoy hiking with my two kids, working on my 2004 Release Series 1.0 Scion xB, and smoking BBQ brisket low and slow.

       I have worked at [Verisk](https://www.verisk.com/) in Lehi, Utah since 2017 in the both QA and engineering capacities. This has given me a unique perspective on the software development lifecycle, and I have been able to leverage this experience to create more robust and maintainable software.

      In the past year, I've been spearheading the development of a revamped web version of our organization's flagship product, [Xactimate](https://xactimate.com/home).
